    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This report considers two common systems for running elections: Plurality, and IRV. Using a two dimensional political opinion model, with a discrete distribution of voters and a ballot of candidate points, I am able to simulate the election of certain set of candidates across the space of possible political climates. These visualizations allow the exploration of limiting cases of the fairness of each system. This investigation yields insight into how to decide which electoral system is best suited for a particular election."

    "## Election Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The two election methods considered in this paper are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plurality Voting\n",
    "In a plurality election, each voter casts a single vote towards their most preferred candidate. At the end, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has the advantage of simplicity, both in the method of computation for a winning candidate and in the logistics of actual implementation in a real election.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instant Runoff Voting\n",
    "In IRV, also called Hare or Single Transferable Voting, an initial round of plurality voting occurs. However, if the candidate with the most votes does not have a majority of the population (More than half), the candidate with the least votes is removed from the ballot, and the election is run again. The process continues until one candidate recieves more than half of the votes, and they are declared the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the cost of additional complexity, IRV allows voters to rank their votes in terms of actual preference, free of any pressure to vote tactically.  "

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, extensibility and clarity, I utilize the common model of political stance as a two dimensional euclidian space, spanned by two orthogonal opinion continuums, often depicted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 1: Political Spectrum\n",
    "![Chart](../code/PoliChart2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific axes labels are domain specific, and irrelevant to the utility of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the voting population is represented by a discretely sampled normal distribution of voters of size N, with a mean (or center) μ and a standard deviation (or spread) σ uniform in both the x and y axes. Here each \"x\" represents an individual voter with some opinion in the political space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 2: Population Distrobution\n",
    "![Dist](../code/dist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar fashion, candidates may be represented as points in the space, with their location reflecting their political platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 3: Candidate Ballot\n",
    "![Cand](../code/cand.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as we vary μ across both axes of the opinion spectrum, we can represent the same candidates in different political climates. For example, in the case of four different centers of opinion, each of the four climates would look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 4: Population Mean Sweep:\n",
    "![Top Left](../code/4splitlq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the voterbase moves, not the candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each voter's preferences are described by the euclidian distance between them and each of the candidates, ranked in increasing order (That is, they prefer the candidate closest to them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these elections can now be run under the variety of election algorithms described earlier, producing a winning candidate in each case. This may be represented as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 5: Election Results as $\\mu$ Varies\n",
    "![Low quality](../code/3lq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the axes are the same as before, the political spectum. The color map shows which candidate is predicted by the model to win if the population was centered around that sector. In this figure, White and Brown win if the population is polarized to the bottom left or upper right respectively, and the moderate Orange wins if the population is centered in the upper left or lower right. By sheer area, Orange seems like the most favored candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher resolution sweep of the space results in a perhaps more intuitive figure of the symmetric situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 6: Higher Resolution Election Results as $\\mu$ Varies\n",
    "![demo2](../code/demo2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Orange is now revealed to be much less favored than previously interpreted, being squeezed into a narrow band of victory conditions."

    "## Arrow's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"Fair\" Election may be defined as:\n",
    "- Deterministic (Yielding the same result every time)\n",
    "- Monotonic (Clear, singular directives for candidates)\n",
    "- Unanimous (Respecting of the will of the people)\n",
    "- Non-Imposing (Where all candidates are viable)\n",
    "- Non-Dictatorial (Not reducible to a single voter’s decision)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrow's Impossibility Theorem states that no electoral system may satisfy all 5 criteria simultaneously. In light of this claim, there is no objectively optimal election method. Instead, different methods satisfy different subsets of the above criteria, and a method may be more or less suitable to any given situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem is only applied to small scale, simple example elections. However, the principle also holds true for large scale, more complex elections. In the following examples, I visualize these limiting cases under more realistic conditions than traditionally considered."

    "## Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plurality\n",
    "\n",
    "A common criticism of plurality voting states that the system creates inherently bias against a third minority candidate in a two candidate election. In order to investigate this sentiment, we may first consider a two candidate election under plurality:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 7: Two Candidate Plurality Elections\n",
    "![tiegood](../code/tiegood.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this figure, Brown is not entirely dominant, but certainly the favored candidate across most of the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can add in a minority candidate even more Up and a smidge more Right:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 8: Three Candidate Plurality Elections\n",
    "![tiebad](../code/tiebad.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though most of the landscape would still prefer the Orange cadidate to the White candidate in this case, Orange becomes much less favored. This introduces the conditions for tactical voting. A voter that supports Brown may want to cast their vote for Orange, to artificially shift $\\mu$ more towards the election results depicted in Fig. 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IRV\n",
    "Now, we may consider IRV compared to Plurality with the same canditate ballot. A very simple case is four candidates spread symetrically across the spectrum. With Plurality, the sweep looks exactly as expected:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 9: Symmetric Four Candidate Plurality Elections\n",
    "![4plurality](../code/4quadplur.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the same election is run with IRV however, less intuitive results occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 10: Symmetric Four Candidate IRV Elections\n",
    "![4IRV](../code/4quadIRV.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature of note here is the \"bloom\" seen around the origin of the graph. As voter opinion becomes more uniformly distributed across all the candidates, IRV becomes very sensitive to individual opinions in the discrete voter distribution. If there is a single outlier, they can disproportionately effect a mostly neutral election. \n",
    "\n",
    "IRV demonstrates more interesting behavior when applied to a less idealized candidate ballot. Let us consider an asymmetric distribution of 4 candidates, first with Plurality:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 11: Asymmetric Four Candidate Plurality Elections\n",
    "![4plur](../code/4plur.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Red is the most moderate candidate, surrounded by more polarized options. While Red is the most acceptable the population as a whole, their winning conditions are rather small, requiring a moderate $\\mu$. Each candidate's path to success is clear and monotonic: The smaller the distance between each candidate and $\\mu$, the better their chance of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us consider the same election under IRV:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 12: Asymmetric Four Candidate IRV Elections\n",
    "![4IRVhq](../code/4irvhq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure shares the same overall shape, but contains disjoint regions of success for candidates, along with concave perimiters of success regions. For example, consider White. If $\\mu$ is around (0,300), in the zone where Pink wins, White has a success condition both to the left and right, or closer and farther away. Critically, this means that White can win the election both by being more or less popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This non-monotonic behavior is counterintuitive, but is a result of the mechanics of IRV. If the current descending order of populatity is (Pink, White, Brown, Red), White can win by giving more votes to Red, causing Brown to be eliminated first. Then a higher percentage of brown's votes can be transferred to White. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Population size\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor to consider when choosing an election method is the size of your electorate. For the same candidate ballot, and elections using IRV, we can look at three separate orders of magnitude of N.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fig. 13 Three Candidate IRV Election where N=200\n",
    "![200](../code/3triIRV200.png)\n",
    "#### Fig. 14 Three Candidate IRV Election where N=2,000\n",
    "![200](../code/3triIRV2000.png)\n",
    "#### Fig. 15 Three Candidate IRV Election where N=20,000\n",
    "![200](../code/3triPlur2000.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As N increases, the discrete distribution of voters becomes a better and better approximation of the continuous normal distribution, and individual voter opinions matter less. This smooths out the sensitivity of IRV to dedicated outlier voters, maintaining the absence of tactical voting while decreasing the drawbacks of IRV. Therefore, IRV has fewer drawbacks in larger scale elections, and is much less well suited to electorates of less than $\\approx$ 1000 voters, as non-monotonic incentives for candidates become more prominant. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there are no completely \"fair\" election systems (as defined by Arrow's Impossibility Theorem), use of this model can help portray how different systems are applicable to certain conditions. Plurality voting is straightforward and rather robust, but supresses minority opinions. IRV voting can be sensitive to outliers, and foster split incentives for candidates, but does allow for minority candidates, and becomes more reasonable at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether using these, some hybrid or even a completely different election system, it is imperative to consider which system optimizes for the most important aspects of the election."
