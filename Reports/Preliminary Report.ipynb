    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to simulate elections as an agent based phenomenon, with a distribution of voters existing in some discrete, multi-dimensional opinion space.\n",
    "Candidates exist as points in the space, and voters are (At least initially) are assumed to be normally distributed around a given center.\n",
    "Simulating multiple voting algorithms (Plurality, Approval, Condorcet, Borda, IRV) can be achieved by assuming that people's candidate preferences go in order of Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these simulations, limiting cases of Arrow's theorem (That no election system can satisfy all 5 fair election criterion) can be demonstrated, and visualizations of voter space can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further expansion can be done by simulating more voting systems, and moving to a higher dimensional space.\n",
    "Interesting data may also result from sweeping candidates across the space, and analyzing the results."

    "\n",
    "First punchline graphs as the same ones from zesty above. These can be analyzed as how different voting systems affect candidate's chances of winning under different political orientations.\n",
    "E.G. Here, under IRV, one can see candidate 3 has an \"M\" shaped winning space.\n",
    "This is non-monotonic leading to very interesting results: more approval for the candidate could cause worse results, and less approval could cause the candidate to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another punchline graph could result from changing the delta between two candidates: E.G keeping one stable and sweeping the other, then plotting overall odds of winning."

    "Plurality voting, election simulation and visualization are all working. This allows replication some components of the targeted experiments above, E.G.\n",
    "\n",
    "![demo2](../Code/demo2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can see how a moderate candidate (in fact completely centered) can be squeezed out by semi-moderates on either side. It is interesting to alse see how the center candidate can appeal to two very extreme opposites in opinion, in the top left and bottom right, created due to the symmetries in the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really perform an actual experiment, a second voting method will need to be fully implemented. Instant runoff voting is almost working at this stage, and will be in a day or two. With IRV, nonmonotonic voting conditions can be demonstrated, which is actually meaningful when compared to the same election run under Plurality voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These graphs are generated by specifying an arbitrary number of candidates, and $\\sigma$ and a range of $\\mu$'s for the population distribution. Then a space of elections is run, and the winner at each point is displayed.\n",

    "Trying to find the self organizing criticality inherent to election systems. (I do believe it is there, it just may be a task to tease it out)\n",
    "Data visualization in python, along with high order complexity algorithm design for voting systems.\n",
    "Technical writing in an easy to understand fashion: I want to be able to clearly and succinctly share my methods and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thoughts thus far\n",
    "I've met the algorithm design and data visualization goals I had, which came in the form of implementing elections and reading much more matplotlib documentation than I needed to in order to generate the graphs seen above. Also, practicing good object oriented structure is nice, and I see myself echoing a lot of Allen's style in my own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm confident the technical writing component will get there when I have things to really write about in the next sprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first goal is really the most unsure, and also the one I've spent the most time thinking about. I'm not sure of what conditions to create and transformation to apply to the data to demonstrate self organized criticality. I think plotting the different rounds of IRV with multiple candidates may be a good angle, will play around with over break."
